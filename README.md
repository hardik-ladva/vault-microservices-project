# Vault Microservices Project

## 🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **HashiCorp Vault** to securely manage secrets in a microservices architecture. It simulates two services (Python scripts) that retrieve their own secrets from Vault. The goal is to help beginners prepare for the **HashiCorp Vault Associate Certification** while building a practical portfolio project.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn Vault setup and configuration
- Understand secrets engines and policies
- Automate secret provisioning
- Connect applications (services) to Vault
- Enable and monitor Vault audit logging
- Use Git and GitHub for version-controlled infrastructure

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads)
- Python 3.x
- `curl` for testing
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/vault-microservices-project.git
cd vault-microservices-project
````

### 2. Start Vault (Dev Mode)

```bash
vault server -dev
```

Or with the config file:

```bash
vault server -config=vault/config.hcl
```

### 3. Export VAULT\_ADDR

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
```

### 4. Run the Vault Setup Script

```bash
bash vault/setup.sh
```

This script will:

* Enable the KV secret engine
* Add secrets for each service
* Create policies and tokens
* Enable file-based audit logs

### 5. Run Services

```bash
# Service 1
export VAULT_TOKEN='<TOKEN-FROM-SETUP>'
python3 services/service1/main.py

# Service 2
export VAULT_TOKEN='<TOKEN-FROM-SETUP>'
python3 services/service2/main.py
```

### 6. Test with Curl

```bash
bash scripts/test-secrets.sh
```

## 🔐 What You'll Learn

| Feature             | Covered In This Project                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Vault server config | `vault/config.hcl`                        |
| Policies            | `vault/policies/*.hcl`                    |
| KV engine           | `vault setup.sh`                          |
| API calls           | `curl` and Python services                |
| Tokens              | Scoped service tokens                     |
| Audit log           | File log at `audit/vault_audit.log`       |
| Access restriction  | Each service can only read its own secret |

---

## 🧪 Example Secret Paths

* `secret/service1` → accessed only by `service1`
* `secret/service2` → accessed only by `service2`

---

## 📦 GitHub Integration

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
→ Create repo `vault-microservices-project`
→ Do **not** initialize with README

### 2. Push Code

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/vault-microservices-project.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for a password, use your **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**.

---

## 🔍 Useful Vault Commands

```bash
vault status
vault secrets list
vault kv get secret/service1
vault policy list
vault token lookup
```

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

* **Permission denied for audit logs:**
  Ensure `audit/` exists and has write permission:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p audit
  chmod 755 audit
  ```

* **"path already in use" error:**
  You're trying to enable a secret engine that's already mounted.

* **"address already in use":**
  Check if Vault is already running:

  ```bash
  lsof -i :8200
  ```
